## Ad Tracker
[Talking Data Ad Tracker Fraud Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection)

To set up the *R Studio* work station, use Lauch Template **lt-015e347f2161b738b**, which uses AMI **ami-67a9de1f**.

 With this project, used the **LightGBM** method and **R**.  Using the Kaggle kernels I was only able to use *45 million* records. With 2 hours to go I am attempting to split this up onto server different machines.

the `light-parts.R` script will generate this over 45 million records using a AWS r3.xlarge machine (32GB RAM)
